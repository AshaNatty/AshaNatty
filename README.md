## About Me

I design and deploy production-grade multi-agent AI systems focused on:

- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) orchestration
- Context engineering and memory architectures
- RAG pipelines with vector search integration
- Structured LLM outputs and function calling
- Banking and numerically intensive AI workflows
- Hybrid cloud + on-prem AI deployments
- Observability and audit-compliant AI systems

My work bridges distributed systems engineering and applied AI, with emphasis on scalability, compliance, and architectural clarity.

- Async execution patterns
- Failure isolation and retry strategies

### Context & Memory Engineering
- Short-term and long-term memory abstraction
- Vector store integration
- Embedding strategy design
- Session continuity logic

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Policy-grounded responses
- Vector search pipelines
- Prompt grounding techniques
- Controlled output generation

### Production AI Engineering
- Structured logging
- Audit trails
- Metrics and observability
- CI/CD integration
- Containerized deployments

## Architecture Philosophy

I approach AI systems as distributed systems:

- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Stateless orchestration layers
- Deterministic interfaces between agents
- Schema-first communication
- Observability by design
- Config-driven behavior
- Production readiness over prototypes

---

## Technical Stack

- Python (async-first design)
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Vector Databases (Chroma, Matching Engine)
- Redis / SQLite memory layers
- Docker / Containerized services
- GitHub Actions CI
- Google Vertex AI

---

## Current Areas of Exploration

- Agent-to-Agent protocol standardization
- Quantitative risk simulation using LLM-assisted workflows
- Hybrid deployment patterns for enterprise AI
- Prompt evaluation and response auditing
- Observability-first AI system design

---

## Connect

Open to discussions on:

- Enterprise AI architecture
- Multi-agent systems
- RAG optimization
- Production deployment of LLM systems
- Banking and regulated AI use cases
